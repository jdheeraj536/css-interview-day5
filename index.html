       <h3>Q> What are pseudo selectors in CSS?</h3>
       Ans:- <pre>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions.
         A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", like this:
        a:hover {
                   /*add your style here */
                }
         
        Syntax: 
         
        selector:pseudo-class {
                   property : value;
                }
         
        Some Examples of Pseudo-Class:
         
         
         
        :active
        It is used to add style to an active element.
        :hover
        It adds special effects to an element when the user moves the mouse pointer over the element.
        :link
        It adds style to the unvisited link.
        :visited
        It adds style to a visited link.
        :lang
        It is used to define a language to use in a specified element.
